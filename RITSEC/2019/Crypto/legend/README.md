Hey Listen! Are you a legend?

At this point we had 2 cipher texts.

```
HEY! LISTEN!
d_ c` db dc cd ca ch c6 cb c7 c5 c6 bh da ba c2 cb bc ba

As given in pre-legend, we knew we were going to use traspositioncypher at some point.

First cipher text was not used at all which really confused me.

Modified the last part to see if we get something.
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
	for item in range(20):
		try:
			main(item)
		except ZeroDivisionError:
			pass
            
```
